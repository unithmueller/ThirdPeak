# ThirdPeak
Application written in MATLAB to help exploring and analyzing 3D track data.
It is still an early version. I would be happy for bug reports and feedback.

Implements code from msdanalzyzer (https://github.com/tinevez/msdanalyzer/tree/master) and meanshiftdriftcorrection (https://github.com/frankfazekas/Mean-Shift-Drift-Correction).
